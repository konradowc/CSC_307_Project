# CSC 307 Project: PostCode


**PostCode** is a location-based blog platform designed for both locals and travelers seeking insights and updates from people living in a specific area. Unlike Facebook, PostCode prioritizes geographic context by connecting users to content created by residentsâ€”without the clutter of unrelated posts or algorithm-driven noise.
