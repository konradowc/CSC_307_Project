CSC 307 Project: PostCode 

For locals and/or travelers who want insights or updates based on people living in a specific area, the PostCode is a location-based blog platform that lets users discover blog posts from people in their selected city. Unlike Facebook, our product prioritizes geographic context by connecting users to content created by residents without the clutter of unrelated posts or algorithmic noise.
